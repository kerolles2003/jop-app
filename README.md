# 📚 Library Management System

A modern, secure **Library Management System** built with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
Provides a robust **JWT-based REST API** for managing books, authors, users, and borrowing operations with **role-based access control**.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `application.yml` to connect to your local PostgreSQL instance:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/
    username:
    password:
```

> ⚠️ Replace `url`, `username`, and `password` with your actual DB credentials.  
> 🧪 On startup, the app will auto-run `data.sql` to insert sample records.
